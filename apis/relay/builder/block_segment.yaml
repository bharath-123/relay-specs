  operationId: "submitBlockSegment"
  summary: Submit a new block segment to the relay. This segment can be a TOB or a ROB. A segment is similar to a full block.
  description: |
    * Block segments can be submitted as JSON or SSZ, and optionally GZIP encoded. To be
      clear, there are four options: JSON, JSON+GZIP, SSZ, SSZ+GZIP. If JSON, the
      content type should be `application/json`. If SSZ, the content type should
      be `application/octet-stream`.

    * Each segment will have a gas limit of 15m gas units. A segment cannot consume more then 15m gas units as it
      has

    * The relayer will pick up the latest highest ROB/TOB bid(ideally from a seperate builder)
      if the segment sent is the highest TOB/ROB bid seen by the relayer
      and sends both the TOB and ROB bids to a local block assembler(specs defined in specs/assembler.md).
      The local block assembler validates the TOB and ROB bids for the type of transactions included in them.
      If the validations are successful, the assembler concatenates the TOB and ROB transactions lists and builds
      a new block from them. This block built is stored in the relayer db and is used by the proposer to propose a block.

    * For accountability, builder signature is over the SSZ encoded `message`.

    * The `message`, which does not include the transactions, will be made
      public via the data API, allowing anyone to verify the builder signature.

    * Any new block segment submission by a builder will overwrite a previous one by the same
      `builder_pubkey`, even if it is less profitable.
